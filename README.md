# CS_DotNet6_CLI_Game_Research

This is a project based on a previous project I did called 'Python_CLI_Game_Research' (https://github.com/justindd1994/Python_CLI_Game_Research).
The Idea for this is to learn the new C# and .Net 6 as a console based app. And what better way than making a console game.
